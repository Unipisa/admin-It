# Admin-It

Admin-It is a parallel corpus of sentences in Italian administrative language for Automatic Readability Assessment (ARA) and Automatic Text Simplification (ATS). The corpus comprises 736 sentence pairs corresponding to two readability levels: original and simplified. We organized the corpus in three subsets according to the different simplification type applied: 

* Operations (OP): 588 pairs of sentences from the subsection of the Simpitiki corpus (Tonelli et al., 2016) related to the administrative domain. The sentences are simplified by means of a sigle simplification operation (e.g., split, reorder, merge, lexical substitutions).

* Rewritten Sents (RS): 100 pairs of original-simplified sentences. The original sentences were selected from websites of Italian municipalities and from the longest phrases from the Pawac Corpus (Passaro and Lenci, 2015). Sentences are manually simplified both at lexical and syntactic levels. Our simplification criteria were based on the Thirty rules for good administrative writing by Cortelazzo (2021) and by considering the traits of the "bureaucratese" (Brunato et al., 2015).

* Rewritten Docs (RD): 48 pairs of sentences selected and manually aligned from administrative documents, which were collected and simplified by Cortelazzo (1998; Cortelazzo et al., 1999) and made publicly available. This resource contains pairs of original-simplified documents rewritten according to linguistic simplification and communicative effectiveness criteria.
